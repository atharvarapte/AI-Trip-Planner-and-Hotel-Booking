# AI-Trip-Planner-and-Hotel-Booking
Final Year MCA Project by Atharva Rapte IICMR, Pune.
Abstract:
The AI Trip Planner is a web-based application developed to streamline and personalize the travel
planning process for users. The platform offers a user-centric interface that allows individuals to create
customized itineraries based on their destination, budget, travel type (solo, couple, group), and trip
duration. By leveraging AI, the system generates tailored travel plans in real time, suggesting
destinations, activities, and accommodations according to user preferences. Key features of the
application include the ability for users to browse and book hotels directly through the platform,
ensuring a seamless trip planning experience. Users can also view, save, and delete itineraries, as well as
manage their profiles in a secure and intuitive environment. The AI Trip Planner is built using the
Django framework for the backend, while the frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
jQuery, and Bootstrap for a responsive and aesthetically appealing user interface. SQLite is used as the
database management system to store user data and itinerary information securely. This system
addresses the challenges of traditional travel planning by automating the process, providing personalized
travel recommendations, and integrating hotel booking, which together make it a modern and efficient
tool for travellers.
Objectives:
Personalized Itinerary Creation – Users can input their destination, budget, travel type, and trip
duration to generate custom travel itineraries with AI-powered suggestions.
• Hotel Booking – Users can browse and book hotels directly through the platform, integrating
accommodations with the rest of their trip plan.
• Search & Filters – Quick and easy search for destinations, activities, and hotels, with filter options
for better customization of itineraries.
• Secure Payments – The platform supports secure payments for hotel bookings, integrating payment
gateways like Razorpay to offer a variety of payment options including cards and UPI.
• User Accounts – Customers can register, log in, and manage their profiles, including viewing saved
itineraries.
• Itinerary Management – Users can save, delete their itineraries as per their preferences, ensuring they
have full control over their trip planning.
• AI Recommendations – Automated recommendations for places to visit, things to do, and hotels,
tailored to the user’s preferences and budget.
